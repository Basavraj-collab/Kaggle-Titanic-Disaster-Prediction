**Kaggle-Titanic-Disaster-Prediction**

   Started with data exploration, checked about missing data and learned which features are important and for this seaborn and matplotlib was used ot to do the visualizations.
   Data preprocessing involved finding of missing values, converted features into numeric ones, grouping values into categories and creating a few new features.
   Training with 8 different classification machine learning models, picked one of them (random forest) based on its perfomance and applied cross validation on it and came with an efficient model.
   Computed confusion matrix and computed the models precision, recall and f-score and submitted the test-set to the Kaggle leaderboard.
